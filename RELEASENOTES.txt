*****************************************************
/* FILES Changed */


		*member_directory.php: 
			(): added 'Search Members' functionality
			(): added buildCondition() function
			(): rf added condition to prevent inactive members being displayed
		
		*listings.php
			(): added 'Keyword' form field
			(process_data): added 'keyword' value to GET request
			
		*member_edit.php
			(process_data): 'join date' and 'dob' no longer passed incorrectly as Arrays to htmlspecialchars() but instead are passed to htmlspecialchars() a bit later on when broken down into Strings
			(): changed form labels 'Admin Level 1/2' etc to 'Admin' and 'Committee'
			(): added option for user to confirm any payments sent to him/her
			(): added social-networking bits to member profile (age, sex etc)
			(): further edits throughout which handle the 'payment confirmation' preferences and social networking variables
			
		*take_monthly_fee.php
			(): fixed bugs relating to SQL syntax and timestamp formatting
			(already_fee_takenp): fixed SQL string syntax problem
		
		*refund_monthly_fee.php
			(select_time): fixed bug relating to SQL syntax problem
			(transfer_fee): fixed SQL syntax bugs and timestamp formatting problems
			
		*admin_menu.php: 
			(): Added 'current balance' display; Added links to new admin functions (described elsewhere); Removed link to missing 'list_member_fees.php'

		*listings_found.php
			(): added code to filter listings results by Keyword if specified

		*exchange_menu.php
			(): added link to trades_pending.php - this file now also calls the trade class to display the number of pending trades in brackets next to the link
			
		*member_create.php
			(): changed form labels 'Admin Level 1/2' etc to 'Admin' and 'Committee'
			
		*member_profile.php

		*trade.php
			(): added lots of additional code to accomodate new Invoicing system and the fact that members now have the option to Confirm any payments sent to them. This form can now be used to send either a payment OR an invoice and I have reworked the code which processes the payment to check whether or not the recipient has elected to Confirm Payments and, if so, store the transaction as 'pending' accordingly. If the user is making a straight payment to a member that HASN'T elected to Confirm Payments then the code will function the same as before - i.e. the recipient gets paid immediately. 
			
		*includes/inc.config.php: 
			(): added options to turn on/off all new features as described
			(): changed 'Hours' to 'LETS Units'
			(): changed 'Directory' to 'Members List'
			(): added preferences for displaying PostCode alongside offers/wants listings

			(): added option to set Permission level for submitting all HTML Tags to the MySQL
			(): ... added option to define a 'Safe List' for HTML Tags that all other users are allowed to submit
			(): added option to define how out-of-balance situation should be handled
			(): added option for admin to receive an email when out-of-balance situation occurs
			(): added provision to allow this file to be included directly from the upgrade script (the upgrade needs access to the MySQL credentials in order to run)
			
		*includes/session_handler.php: 
			(): added some wrapper functions to accomodate newer/older versions of PHP (some of the original functions were either deprecated or incompatible with anything older than v4.2.3 - probably not a huge problem in most cases but these changes shouldn't break anything)

		*classes/class.listing.php
			(cListingGroup::DisplayListingGroup): some slight changes to the way Offers/Wants are displayed, including way member name and ID displayed
			(cListingGroup::DisplayListingGroup): added display postcode alongside listings

			(cMember::DisplayMember): adjusted to accomodate display of member image
		
		*classes/class.person.php
			(cPerson::cPerson): added code to retrieve the new data in the db related to social networking
			(cPerson::SavePerson): altered sql query to store social networking data
			(cPerson::LoadPerson): altered sql query to retrieve social networking data
														 added code to store the retrieved social networking vars in $this-> variables

			(cTrade::MakeTrade): added additional option for handling out-of-balance silently - also code to email admin when out-of-balance occurs
		
		*classes/class.uploads.php
			(cUpload::cUpload): added explicit definition for $filename property - not sure whether this being there or not has any impact on functionality
			(cUpload::DisplayURL): RF added target=_blank to anchor tag
		
		*classes/class.database.php:
			(cDatabase::EscTxt): added call to new HTML screening function
			(cDatabase::ScreenHTML): new HTML screening function
			(cDatabase::ProcessHTMLTag): new function to screen individual HTML tags passed from cDatabase::ScreenHTML

			(process_data): fixed htmlspecialchars() issue

			(process_data): fixed htmlspecialchars() issue
				
		*info/credits.php
			(): changes to the copy made by RF

Below are the original release notes for 0.3.2... 

PLEASE NOTE THAT UPGRADE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW NO LONGER APPLY TO ver 0.4.0 or version 1.0 UK - to upgrade from ver 0.3.2 to ver 0.4.0 please use the UPGRADE package (localexchange-upgrade-0.4.0.zip) instead of this package (localx-UK-1.0.zip), and to upgrade from ver 0.4.0 to ver 1.0 UK please use the UPGRADE package (localx-UK-upgrade-0.4-to-1.0.zip). All these files are available via LETSlinkUK and http://cxss.info

-------------

In addition to a number of bugfixes, several major features have been added in version 0.3.2.  Grab yourself a cup of coffee and read on...

Members can now opt to receive automatic email updates containing new offered and wanted listings.  In order to take advantage of this feature, you will need to turn it on in inc.config.php.

The ability to send an email to all member accounts has been added to the administration menu.

There is a new optional feature to automatically expire listings for inactive members. This is an attempt to deal with the age-old local currency problem of new members joining and then not keeping their listings up to date or using the system in any way.  It is designed so that if a member doesn't record a trade OR update a listing in a given period of time (default is six months), their listings will be set to expire and they will receive an email to that effect (as will the admin).  This feature can be turned on (and default settings configured) in inc.config.php.

If you are interesting in becoming involved in development for Local Exchange, email calvinpriest@yahoo.com.  Our CVS has just been turned on at local-exchange, and we are ready to boogie.

Here's a partial list of other changes:
- Bug fix: There is a rather major bug (in the view of many) in PHP 4.4.  It has resulted in many PHP applications breaking (including this one because of it's use of PEAR libraries) when servers are upgraded to 4.4.  A workaround has been implemented in Local Exchange.
- Made password requirements less stringent and now generate "pronouncable passwords".
- Trade statistics now show when viewing a listing, so members can easily identify active traders.
- The ability to upload newsletters in document formats such as PDF has been added.  The newsletters can be viewed from a link on the bottom of the News & Events page.
- A maintenance mode has been added for system administration purposes.  You can turn it on by setting DOWN_FOR_MAINTENANCE to true.
- A method for upgrading the system by script has been added.  See UPGRADE.txt for the upgrade process.
- A report has been added to the administration page to view members who have never logged in. 
- Bug fix: The ADMIN account can no longer record trades.
- Bug fix: The option to create new Non-Member Admin Accounts has been turned off, both because it was unnecessary and confusing.
- Bug fix for unlocking accounts
- Bug fix: Fixed directory so duplicate phones and emails not displayed for joint members.
- Bug fix: Now use wordwrap for email messages.
- Bug fix: Timeframe selection for trades doesn't restrict things past the higher date.
- Bug fix: Fixed issue with long feedback text being truncated.
- Bug fix: Turned off autocomplete in the listing description field.  This was confusing to some.
- Bug fix: Made null dates blank in listing create/edit pages.
- inc.config.php has been overhauled to make it easier to read and to setup a new site.
